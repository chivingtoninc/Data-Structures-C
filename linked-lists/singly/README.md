## Prerequisites
  * Some C compiler.


## Installation
```
  cd /path/to/where/you/want/it
  git clone https://github.com/chivingtoninc/Data-Structures-C.git
```

## Illustration
A singly-linked list only has a few key attributes that you need to remember. See **Figure 1-1**
  1. It is made of individual nodes.
  2. Each node stores some data, and a pointer to the next node in the list.
  3. You can insert and delete nodes from the list at a given index in linear time. That is, the further down the list, the longer it takes to insert or delete a node at that position.

## Testing
Navigate to an example in the Data-Structures-C directory and compile/run.

Assuming your C compiler is GCC and you're on Linux:
```
  cd /path/to/Data-Structures-C/singly
  gcc singly.c -o singly
  ./singly
```

Assuming your C compiler is GCC and you're on Windows:
```
  cd /path/to/Data-Structures-C/singly
  gcc singly.c -o singly
  singly
```

## Usage
Only real use is for learning about Linked Lists. You can copy into a bigger project, but this should not be considered production-ready in any way. Simply follow the steps in **Testing** to use.
